Here we will share examples of creations made with [Scratch 3.0](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and the extension for Boost together with [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/boost), the helper app that lets us connect [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to Boost.

## Requirements

Connect [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) with Boost. Really it is very simple it is only required to have installed on the computer the “[Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/boost)” and use the [Scratch editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/).
