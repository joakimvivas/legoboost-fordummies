# First steps with Lego Boost

Use [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is really simple, the first step is to add the Boost extension and then connect to the LEGO Move Hub to start operating commands (Remember, it is a requirement to have installed [Scratch Link](https://scratch.mit.edu/boost))

When we have the Lego Boost connected to the Scratch… it is time to play hard!!!

## Moving around the board

My first recommendation is to create new blocks, completely personalised for our requirements, for example in my case I created three blocks:
- Moving to the right,
- Moving to the left,
- Moving forward.

It is a simple and useful option to start playing Lego Boost in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). In the photo we have, on the left, the definitions (left, right, forward) and, on the right, a sequence prepared for Boost to execute, when we hit the green flag.
